# CarPrice-Prediction-Linear-Regression
A car price prediction model using linear regression with preprocessing and evaluation. Built with Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn.

The Car Price Prediction model is a machine learning model that uses the power of regression algorithms to predict the price of a car. This model is implemented using the Python programming language and makes use of the following libraries:

Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib and Seaborn: for data visualization
Sklearn: for machine learning algorithms and preprocessing techniques
The model starts by loading the dataset into a pandas dataframe, and performing exploratory data analysis to get insights into the data. Visualizations are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to better understand the relationship between various features and the target variable (price of the car).

The data is then preprocessed using Sklearn's StandardScaler to standardize the features and remove any skewness. The data is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from Sklearn.

The model uses a Linear Regression algorithm from Sklearn to fit the training data and make predictions on the test data. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-Squared.

In summary, this Car Price Prediction model is a comprehensive solution for predicting the price of a car based on various features such as make, model, year, etc. The model is easy to use, train, and evaluate, and can be a useful tool for car dealerships and buyers.
